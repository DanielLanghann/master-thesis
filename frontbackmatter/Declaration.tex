\noindent
The assurance of independent work also applies to any drawings, sketches, or graphic representations contained therein.

\medskip

\noindent
The paper has not been submitted in the same or similar form to the same or any other examination authority nor has it been published.

\medskip

\noindent
By submitting the electronic version of the final paper, I acknowledge that it may be checked for plagiarism using a plagiarism detection service and will be stored exclusively for examination purposes.
